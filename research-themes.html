            <p>Our approach towards our group's objectives follows three main research themes combining expertise in different research areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">{{site.delta}}</p>
                    <p>are the cornerstone of modern Artificial Intelligence and
                        data-driven systems. We focus on Data Engineering, and research ways of preparing data for its
                        deployment or usage in a complex AI/data-driven system. In Scalable Data Management, the focus
                        is on how to cope with the ever-increasing demand for storage and processing power by scaling
                        data
                        operations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">{{site.kappa}}</p>
                    <p> represent core areas which are instrumental in developing the
                        next generation of data-driven AI systems, which reply on Human-in-the-loop
                        computing, Human-AI interaction, User Modeling and Explainability. These areas consider the
                        computational role of humans for data-driven AI, i.e.,
                        AI augmented or supported by humans, and the interactional role of humans with AI systems, i.e.,
                        AI for humans.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold">{{site.lambda}}</p>
                    <p>
                        is concerned with the development of algorithms and interface elements to enable people to satisfy their information needs
                        by retrieving and presenting results from large collections of mostly unstructured documents. Besides this system-oriented view,
                        this research field also has a user-oriented focus that explores how &amp; why people search and reach decisiond based on 
                        information accessed.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
