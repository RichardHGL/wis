## About
As a Ph.D. Candidate at the Web Information Systems group of the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at the Delft University of Technology, I am working on generating human-understandable explanations for group recommendations using Natural Language Techniques, focusing on user’s privacy concerns. I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Nava Tintarev.

I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Munich where I was supervised by Dr. Wolfgang Woerndl. Besides, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Information Technology Engineering from the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences University of Iran.
