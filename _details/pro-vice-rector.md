## Pro Vice Rector AI
**Prof.dr.ir. Geert-Jan Houben is Pro Vice Rector Magnificus Artificial Intelligence, Data and Digitalisation (PVR AI) at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).**

The PVR AI leads the TU Delft activities in the field of AI, data and digitalisation, for education, for research and valorisation, and for relevant support. This includes the establishment of TU Delft AI Labs to promote cross-fertilisation between AI experts and scientists who use AI in their research. It also includes the representation of TU Delft in regional, national and international co-operation on this theme.

**Artificial Intelligence, Data and Digitalisation at TU Delft**

AI, data and digitalisation play a major role in TU Delft’s core activities of education, research and valorisation. They are also increasingly essential for solving important scientific and social issues. Thus, they are vital for the fulfilment of TU Delft’s mission: creating impact for a better society.

A lot is already taking place within the university in the field of AI, data and digitalisation: we are researching it and using it in our research. Moreover, our teaching in this field is also growing in importance.

To streamline all these efforts there is a need for more coordination and a systematic approach, for education, for research and valorisation, and for relevant support. For this reason, the PVR AI leads the overarching TU Delft AI Initiative (AIDU). Present activities under the AIDU umbrella include education, research and valorisation, and the establishment of labs to promote cross-fertilisation between AI experts and scientists who use AI in their research. The PVR AI will also take a leading role on behalf of TU Delft in regional, national and international co-operation on this theme.
