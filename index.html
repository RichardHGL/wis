                The Web Information Systems (WIS) group focuses on research &amp; education in data-based information
                systems on the Web and making them more effective in retrieving, processing and interpreting data
                generated by humans and machines.
                The overall mission of the WIS research group is:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>to develop a deep understanding of the construction and use of web-based information systems,</li>
                <li>to develop novel methods, techniques, and tools that advance the way in which web-based information
                    systems are constructed and used, and
                </li>
                <li>to offer students education that prepares them for a leading role in web-based information systems
                    science and technology.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="font-weight-light">Research</h4>
            <div class="row margin-top-2 justify-content-center">
                <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/wis-circle.png" alt="WIS-Circle" align="right" width="40%">
            </div>

            <h4 class="font-weight-light">Focus</h4>
            <p>In the Web Information Systems research group, we aim at making web information systems more effective in
                retrieving, processing and interpreting data generated by humans and machines.</p>

            <h4 class="font-weight-light">Objectives</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>To understand what human‐ and machine-generated web data represents in terms of people's actions,
                    interests, intents, and behaviors on the web.
                </li>
                <li>To develop new solutions to meet the fundamental challenges in how systems effectively attribute and
                    exploit semantics for human‐ and machine-generated data, given the size and dynamic nature of the
                    web.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="font-weight-light">Approach</h4>

            Our approach towards our objectives of understanding and developing, combines four main research areas:
            <ul>
                <li>Data Management</li>
                <li>Human Computing & Human-Centered AI</li>
                <li>Information Retrieval</li>
                <li>User Modeling & Explainability</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="font-weight-light">Disciplines</h4>
            <p>
                As WIS researchers, together with our students, we strive to advance the state-of-the-art in relevant
                disciplines like user modeling, Web science, information retrieval, natural language processing,
                database systems, Web engineering, Web data management, user interaction, human computing, and human-AI
                interaction. We contribute to and impact these scientific disciplines by publishing in the top venues in
                these fields and by actively serving in the organization and program committees of relevant conferences
                and in editorial boards of relevant journals.
