## About

I am a PhD candidate at TU Delft on the topic of neural rankers for conversational search and recommendation under the supervision of Claudia Hauff. I have BSc and MSc degrees from the Department of Computer Science of UFMG :brazil:, where I was supervised by Rodrygo Santos. On my spare time I like to do street photography.
