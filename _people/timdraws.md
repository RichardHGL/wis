## About
I studied Psychology at the University of Amsterdam, where I specialized in statistics and research methods (also sometimes called *Psychological Methods* or *Behavioural Data Science*). Currently, my research focuses on understanding how algorithmic and cognitive biases in web search affect user attitudes on debated topics.
