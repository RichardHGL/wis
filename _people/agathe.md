Agathe is a PhD candidate at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), and a member of the Web Information Systems group.

Agathe works on developing human-in-the-loop algorithmic methods to identify issues of undesired biases and unfairness in machine learning models, especially for computer vision applications. 
She aims at leveraging explainability methods to understand the inner mechanisms of the models, and human knowledge to extract the requirements for these models. With that, she wants to reason quantitatively about the problematic biases that might have been introduced in the model.

Besides, she also creates and evaluates tools for supporting practitioners in identifying their bias and fairness requirements and specifying them into their development and deployment pipelines for data and machine learning model engineering.
