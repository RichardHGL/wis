## About

Hi! Iâ€™m a Postdoc researcher working on scalable stream processing and data integration with Assis. Prof. Asterios Katsifodimos at the Web Information Systems group in Delft University of Technology (TUDelft).

I have a PhD in main memory data analytics from the Department of Management Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business supervised by Prof. Diomidis Spinellis. Before that I received an MSc with distinction in Computer Science from the Department of Computing of the Imperial College London, and a BSc also from the Department of Management Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business.

I have worked as a cloud software engineer at GRNET and as a software engineer at COSMOTE where I built and operated big data workflows.
