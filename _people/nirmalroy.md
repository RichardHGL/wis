## About

I am currently (since September 2019) doing my PhD in the Web Information Systems group of TU Delft under the guidance of Claudia Hauff. I also obtained my Computer Science MSc degree (August 2019) under her with a specialisation in Data Science. I have a BSc degree (August 2016) in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata. I also worked in PriceWaterhouse Coopers, India for a year as a technical consultant before catching my flight for this beautiful city of Delft. My research is focused on understanding how people search the web while they are trying to learn a complex topic (e.g. the causes and implications of glogal warming or the offside rule in football).
