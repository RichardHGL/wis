We focus on important challenges that need to be addressed to make advances in the next generation of AI systems from two main standpoints â€“ (1) Human-in-the-loop AI, and (2) Human-AI interaction. The former concerns the computational role of humans for AI, i.e., AI by humans, while the latter concerns the interactional role of humans with AI systems, i.e., AI for humans.
