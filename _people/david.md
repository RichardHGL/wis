## About
Since March 2020, David has been a postdoctoral researcher in the Lambda Lab of the Web Information Systems group, working with Dr Claudia Hauff. He obtained his PhD from the University of Glasgow, Scotland, in June 2019, under the supervision of Dr Leif Azzopardi. His research interests lie in the intersection of Information Retrieval and Human-Computer Interaction, namely *Interactive Information Retrieval*. He has conducted numerous user studies examining behavioural changes in individuals when using search engines, and has developed numerous simulations of interaction where he has *simulated* these users. Currently, David is investigating how we can develop a better understanding of how individuals react to interface changes, and how we can potentially apply these insights into more complex simulations of interaction. He also has extensive knowledge in web engineering, and since 2013, David has been the co-author of a popular ebook on the basics of web application development in Python, called [Tango with Django](https://www.tangowithdjango.com).
