We focus on two core areas which are instrumental in developing the next generation of AI systems â€“ (1) Human-in-the-loop AI, and (2) Human-AI interaction. The former concerns the computational role of **humans for AI**, i.e., AI *by* humans, while the latter concerns the interactional role of **humans with AI** systems, i.e., AI *for* humans.
