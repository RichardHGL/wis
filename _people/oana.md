## About 

Oana Inel is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Computer Science department at Delft University of Technology, in the Web Information Systems group. Oana did her PhD in the User-Centric Data Science group at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, where her research focused on detecting, representing and exploiting events and their explicit semantics for organizing and representing knowledge on the Web. Currently, Oana is working in the Responsible Data Science track in the Digital Society research programme, where her main focus is on the development of AI-driven, human-centric solutions for the digital society. Oanaâ€™s research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Human Computation. She focuses on understanding the gap between machines and humans, and gaining insights on how machines can collaborate with humans to better support their needs and preferences. Furthermore, Oana is investigating the use of explanations as a means of providing transparency for decision-support systems and fostering reflective thinking in people.
