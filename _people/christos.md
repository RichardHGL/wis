## About

I am a PhD Candidate at the Web Information Systems group of the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science at Delft University of Technology. I am supervised by Asterios Katsifodimos and Christoph Lofi. My research is focused on Data Integration, and specifically Schema Matching, while I have also worked on spatial data management.

I hold a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Computer Science from HKUST, where I was supervised by Prof. Dimitris Papadias. Prior to that, I obtained my 5-year Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from National Technical University of Athens.
