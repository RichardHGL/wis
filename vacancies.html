                    <p>We are seeking motivated individuals interested in pursuing a PhD in Computer Science.
                        Ideal candidates would have a MSc degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or a related field, be broadly interested in Human Computation and Crowdsourcing,
                        and in building hybrid human-machine systems to tackle problems of societal importance.
                        We aim to attract multiple PhD candidates in the Crowd Computing team headed by
                        <a href="http://yangjiera.github.io/" target="_blank">Jie Yang</a> and <a href="https://www.ujwalgadiraju.com/" target="_blank">Ujwal Gadiraju</a>
                        at the Web Information Systems group of the EEMCS faculty at TU Delft.
                    </p>

                    <p>Crowd computing involves algorithmic engagement and coordination of people by means of Web-enabled platforms.
                        These complex tasks are mainly focused on the creation, enrichment, and interpretation of data, making crowd
                        computing a building block of data science: from

                        to Microsoft, from

                        all major companies employ crowd computing to fulfil their data needs, both by involving employees, and by reaching out
                        to anonymous crowds through online marketplaces like Amazon Mechanical Turk. The Crowd Computing team will focus on leveraging
                        human intelligence in combination with machines to solve important problems that breach multiple disciplines including Machine Learning,
                        Information Retrieval, Computer Vision and NLP.

                    <p> We are of course dependent on the availability of funding, but we have a number of projects lined up, so you can make your interest known to us.</p>

                        Post-doc position: Developing Diversity Metrics for Social Media
                    </h4>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>People are using information technologies like news aggregators and social media platforms to get and share information at an increasing rate.
                        This has great potential; a more knowledgeable citizenry creates more stable democracies. However, filtering and ranking algorithms such as recommender
                        systems can contribute to increased polarization. Understanding and finding solutions to complex (societal) issues on the other hand often requires us to
                        view those issues from a variety of perspectives.
                    </p>

                    <p>The research will entail outlining which features of diversity in news promotes epistemic ends (e.g., knowledge, understanding),
                        and tools for measuring this diversity. The use case will be focused on discussions of news on Twitter and the news sources that people
                        link to from Twitter on debated topics. The results of the research will be a toolkit for measuring diversity on a variety of dimensions
                        (e.g., diversity in viewpoint, diversity in topics, and diversity in reasons for or against a given viewpoint).
