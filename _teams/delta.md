Data Management is one of the central challenges in developing
modern software systems. The need for more sophisticated Data
Management is even more emphasized in the current times of Artificial 
Intelligence and Big Data-based systems which have even more demanding 
data requirements than traditional Data Management had to consider. 
At Web Information Systems, led by assistant professors Christoph Lofi
and Asterios Katsifodimos in collaboration with prof. Geert-Jan Houben,
we focus on two core aspects of modern Data Management: a) Data Engineering, and b) Scalable Data Management.


1. In Data Engineering, we focus on preparing data for its deployment or
  usage in a complex AI/data-driven system. This covers for example 
  discovering data, cleaning data, transforming data, or integrating data
  from heterogenous sources. Also, there is a focus on (domain-specific) 
  meta-data creation and management. Furthermore, aspects of data biases 
  and potentially arising societal issues like misrepresentation and 
  unfairness become focus area. Data Engineering topics are often seen in
  the context of their application domains, like Digital Humanities, 
  medicine, but also business application like banking.
2. For Scalable Data Management, the focus is on how to cope with the 
  ever-increasing demand for storage and processing power by scaling data 
  operations. This covers for example methods for stream-processing but 
  also flexible distribution schemes or the deployment of scalable AI-models.
