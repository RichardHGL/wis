## About
I am a PhD candidate interested in data management and supervised by 
Asterios Katsifodimos. My research is on interactive dataset discovery,
and I aim at improving the process of dataset discovery by actively
engaging the user in the workflow. 

I hold a MSc degree in Data Science from TU Delft and a BSc in 
Computer Science form Politehnica University of Bucharest. 

I am from Romania, I love mountains and doing sport activities in nature. 
For more, follow me on my social accounts and keep an eye on my
