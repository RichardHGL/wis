                        We are seeking motivated individuals interested in pursuing a PhD in Computer Science. Ideal candidates would have a MSc degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or a related field, be broadly interested in Human Computation and Crowdsourcing, and in building hybrid human-machine systems to tackle problems of societal importance. We aim to attract multiple PhD candidates in the Crowd Computing team headed by Jie Yang and Ujwal Gadiraju at the Web Information Systems group of the EEMCS faculty at TU Delft.

                        Crowd computing involves algorithmic engagement and coordination of people by means of Web-enabled platforms. These complex tasks are mainly focused on the creation, enrichment, and interpretation of data, making crowd computing a building block of data science: from Facebook to Microsoft, from Google to IBM, from Spotify to Pandora, all major companies employ crowd computing to fulfil their data needs, both by involving employees, and by reaching out to anonymous crowds through online marketplaces like Amazon Mechanical Turk. The Crowd Computing team will focus on leveraging human intelligence in combination with machines to solve important problems that breach multiple disciplines including Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Computer Vision and NLP.

                        We are of course dependent on the availability of funding, but we have a number of projects lined up, so you can make your interest known to us.

                        In order to indicate your interest, please send your complete CV to Dr. Ujwal Gadiraju (Assistant Professor) and Prof. Dr. Geert-Jan Houben (Full Professor and head of the Web Information Systems group) prefixing the email subject with [Crowd Computing - PhD Application].
