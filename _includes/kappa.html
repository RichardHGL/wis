            <p>We focus on two core areas which are instrumental in developing the next generation of AI systems â€“ 
                (1) Human-in-the-loop AI, and (2) Human-AI interaction. 
                The former concerns the computational role of humans for AI, i.e., AI by humans, while the latter concerns the interactional role of humans with AI systems, i.e., AI for humans.</p>

            <h3>Human-in-the-loop AI</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <p> Machine learning models have been criticized for the lack of robustness, fairness, and transparency. 
                For models to learn comprehensive, 
                fine-grained, and unbiased patterns, they have to be trained on a large number of high-quality data instances with the 
                right distribution that is representative of real application scenarios. Creating such data is not only a long, laborious, 
                and expensive process, but sometimes even impossible.
                In this theme, we analyze the fundamental computational challenges in the quest for robust, interpretable, and trustworthy AI systems. 
                We argue that to tackle such fundamental challenges, research should explore a novel crowd computing paradigm where diverse and distributed crowds
                can contribute knowledge at the conceptual level.

            <h3>Human-AI Interaction</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <p>In the light of recent advances in AI and the growing role of AI technologies in human-centered applications, 
                a deeper exploration of interaction between humans and machines is the need of the hour. 
                Within this theme of Human-AI interaction, we will explore and develop fundamental
                methods and techniques to harness the virtues of AI in a manner that is beneficial and useful to the society at large.
                From the interaction perspective, more robust and interpretable systems can help build trust and increase system uptake. 
                As AI systems become more commonplace, people must be able to make sense of their encounters and interpret their interactions with such systems.
