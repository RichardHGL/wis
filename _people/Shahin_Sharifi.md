## About
I am a PhD candidate at the Web Information Systems group of the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS/EWI), Delft University of Technology.

My research mainly focuses on multi-modal representation learning and human-centered AI. I develop novel methods and tools that combine machine and human intelligence to extract structured information from unstructured data(image,text) to be used in downstream applications such as recommender systems and urban analytics. 

I received my M.Sc. from TU Munich in 2015, and B.Eng. from USC Tehran in 2011. Beside my PhD, I had the opportunity to work in industry as a Senior Software Engineer. I was involved in designing and developing several enterprise systems in a variety of domains such as Banking, Insurace, Retail, and etc.

My research project is a collaboration between the Web Information Systems (WIS) research group and <a href="https://www.wigeogis.com/en/home">WIGeoGIS GmbH</a>, under the supervision of Prof. dr. ir. Alessandro Bozzon.
