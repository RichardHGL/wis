## About
I am a PhD Candidate at Delft University of Technology and my research focuses on how can multimodal music collections be efficiently and effectively annotated through knowledge crowdsourcing. I am supervised by Alessandro Bozzon and Christoph Lofi and I am part of the Web Information Systems group at the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science.

I hold a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Science from Delft University of Technology and an M.Sc. in Digital Visual Effects from University of Kent. Lastly, I conducted my 4-year Bachelor (B.Sc.) studies in Cultural Technology and Communication at the University of Aegean.
