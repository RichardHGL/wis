## Research
#### Research Interests

Currently, my main research area is engineering and science of the Web. The research specifically considers the role of Web data in the engineering of Web-based information systems.

In the Web Information Systems group, we aim at making
**web information system engineering more effective in processing, retrieving and interpreting human‐generated web data**.
Extracting __semantics__ from people's actions and behaviors on the web enables systems that are __personalized and adaptive__.
Our first research objective is **to understand what human‐generated web data represents in terms of people's actions, interests, intents, and behaviors on the web**.
Through data science and web science research, we develop theories on how web data can provide insights about system users. Our second objective is **to develop new solutions to meet the fundamental challenges in how systems effectively attribute semantics to human‐generated data, given the size and dynamic nature of the web**.
We implement and analyze approaches for augmenting web systems with the capability to process, retrieve, and interpret web data, and subsequently adapt to their users.

In this context, we investigate three research topics:
- **Web‐based user modeling**: How can human‐generated data that are retrieved and semantically enriched from the web, be used to enhance systems’ interpretation of people’s actions for user-adaptation?
- **Web data processing and retrieval**: How to efficiently process data at web‐scale and design effective information retrieval mechanisms for domain‐specific web tasks?
- **Human‐enhanced web systems**: What are effective ways to augment web‐based systems with automated, large‐scale human computation and interaction?

This research includes topics in processing, retrieving, and interpreting Web data, with focus on
the **special properties of Web data**: 1) a large portion of Web data is human-made, e.g. in social networks or
Twitter streams, and this brings scientific challenges in how to effectively attribute meaning to Web data; 2)
the size of the Web brings challenges in how to efficiently store, index, and analyze data at Web scale.
WIS researchers and students strive to advance the state-of-the-art in relevant disciplines like
**user modeling, Web science, information retrieval, Web engineering, Web data management, user interaction, and crowdsourcing**.

This research is part of the area of data science, where with Delft Data Science we aim to advance the state of the art in data science in a variety of domains, such as urban innovation, in collaboration with AMS Institute, or online education, in collaboration with TU Delft Extension School and LDE Centre for Education & Learning.
